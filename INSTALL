This project uses autoconf.

If you are building directly from the repository, then the configure script
will need to be generated.  If you are building from a tarball distribution,
and a `configure` script already exists, you can skip this step.

    $ autoreconf --verbose --install --symlink

Then run the generated `configure` script:

    $ ./configure

Or, if a dedicated "build" directory is desired, create one and perform
the configure in there, e.g.

    $ mkdir build && cd build && ../configure

Then run make to compile the sources:

    $ make -j

Then install (probably as root):

    # make install
